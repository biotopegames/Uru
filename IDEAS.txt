What is the trinity hook of the game?


story hook - a lost tribe: a tribe that was the protectors of the realm has almost been vanquished you have to find these protectors scattered around the map
and they willl slowly populate your city to replenish the tribe. URU is the name of the Chieftan summoner of the tribe. 


mechanical hook - metroidvania but with monster taming

music and visual hook - tribal music, synth, flute, marimba, piano, guitar etc.
 visual hook natural less saturated colors/ Grim. 




For centuries the tribe of Zaku valley had lived in peace and harmony with all the creatures of the land. Being at peace with their surroundings.

The Zaku tribe was the protector of the realm and had ancient knowledge allowing them to summon Guardian Creatures.

However, the summoner taruk did not see the beauty in the way of living and was seeking to exploit the power. So he was cast out from the tribe.

On the special day announcing the new chieftan summoner called URU, Taruk led an unsuspected attack and destroyed the entire tribe.
Or so he thought...









NEW GAME IDEA: 

3D game walk through dungeon levels castle several levels 
walk freely but when you encounter enemies you walk based of your walk dice + grid movement + you have theese cards and abilities etc you can use
press space to end turn 
should be prompted if you try to enter door: "you can hear some strange noises through the door, are you sure you want to enter?" 
and in some cases there are enemies other times bosses or nice treassure. 

clear through all the levels to final boss before moving on to new stages.

- Could have the create only be the guardian of the camp and when something has finished
a create will come and attack the castle you should then use your companion to defend the camp with.
